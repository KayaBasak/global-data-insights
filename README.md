##📌 Project 1 — Does Money Really Buy Happiness?

This project examines the relationship between national income and life satisfaction across countries using data from:
* The World Happiness Report
* The World Bank (GDP per capita, PPP)

Detailed blog post: [![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-Read%20Article-black?logo=medium)](...) 

The analysis explores:
* The correlation between income and happiness
* Regression results
* Whether GDP alone explains national well-being
* Countries that overperform or underperform relative to income

The findings show that income strongly predicts happiness, but it does not tell the whole story.

Tools
* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* statsmodels
