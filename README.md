### 🔍 What This Project Examines
* The correlation between income and happiness
* Regression results
* Whether GDP alone explains national well-being
* Countries that overperform or underperform relative to income

### 📊 Key Insight
The findings show that income strongly predicts happiness, but it does not tell the whole story.

### 🛠 Tools
* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* statsmodels

## 📌 Project 2 — The Geography of Happiness

This project explores global patterns of life satisfaction using data from:
* The World Happiness Report (2011–2024)

### 🔍 What This Project Examines
* Long-term average happiness by country
* Top and bottom country rankings
* Continent-level comparisons
* Geographic clustering through world maps
* Stability of happiness over time (standard deviation)
* The relationship between average happiness and volatility

### 📊 Key Insight 
Happiness is not randomly distributed across the globe. It clusters regionally and shows structural patterns.

Countries with higher average happiness tend to exhibit lower volatility over time (correlation ≈ -0.52), suggesting that well-being is not only about reaching high levels — but sustaining them.

### 🛠 Tools
* Python
